ABOUT
Welcome

I am Antonio Latimore. I Lead, Mentor and Advocate for Black Men seeking positive direction.

Developing the mindset that allows for the opportunity to deploy logical choices that best benifit the health and well being in a given situation with out causing harm to those involved.

Understanding your actions and responsibilities is challenging in ways you may never imagine. To give the opportunity to recognize and react in a situation with logical reasoning that set forth the best course of action resulting in positive results without harm to those involved.

Remain firm under suffering or misfortune without yielding. Persist in the undertaking of the responcibilty for your actions in spite of counterinfluences, opposition, or discouragement

The stories we share of our life experience contain the ability to encourage and help propel the development of those seeking a positive direction.

A key componant is the will to carry on through adversity.
